'Hafslund digital designsystem' is a design system that can be used across projects while maintaining consistancy. The project follows strict naming guidlines, your can read more about them in the [wiki](https://github.com/hafslundnett/hdd-theme/wiki/Naming-guidelines). Every component should be able to run in a isolated environment without depending on parent classes/elements.

For every used front-end framework a separate 'components' library should be created. Listed below are the already existing libraries. If you want to add your library to this list, please create a pull request.
