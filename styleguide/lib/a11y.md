## Visibility

Sometimes there is a need to hide content on a page for various reasons. It is importat that it still conveys the correct meaning to people who use screen readers. We should follow these principles regarding on the situation to keep everything accessible, wether you are visually impaired or not:

### Hide from everyone

Use the [`hidden` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden) to hide content from everyone.

### Hide from screen readers

Use the attribute `aria-hidden="true"` to hide content from screen readers. It will still appear visually on the page.

### Hide visually only

Use the class `.is-visually-hidden` to hide content visually only. This will still be read by screen readers.
